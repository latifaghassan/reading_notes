# Design web pages with CSS

## "LINKS"

**Linking to a specifc part of the same page :**<br>

when you want to add links to the corresponding sections lower down.<br> 
Or you want to add a link from bottom of the page to get you back to the p of the page.<br> 
You can do that by using "id attribute".<br>
You can add it with the < h1 > or < h2 > <br>
The value of the id attribute should start with a letter or an underscore not a number or any other character.<br>
No two id attributes should have the same value. <br>
You write the id attribute on a single page. <br> <br>

Its syntax should be something like that : <br>
< h1 id+"top">element at the top of the page whose id attribute has a value of top< /h1> 
< a href ="#value of id attribute link"><br>

**Linking to a specific part of another page:** <br>

Its syntax should be something like that.<br>

< a href+"link#bottom">
