# JS Debugging Summary  :



## Whats is Debugging? <br>
- it is the process of finding errors. because it is normal that programming code might contain syntax errors or logical errors. Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging. 
- Yous could use the console to help narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
- JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error. 

## Common Errors : <br>
- The capitalization-missing errors [ javaScript is sensitive ].
- Missed or Extra Character. 
- Data type issues, e.g : [ using = instead of == ].

## Debugging Tips : <br>
- Some problems are browser-specific. Try the code in another browser to see which ones are causing a problem. 
- Write numbers to the console so you can see which items get logged. 
- Remove parts of code, and strip it down to the minimum you need. You can do this either by removing the code altogether or by just commenting it out using multi-line comments.
