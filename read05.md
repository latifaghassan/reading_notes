# Operators and Loops Summary

**Comparison operators evaluating conditions :** 

= = **"is equal to"**
to compare between two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are the same.

! = **"is not equal to"**
to compare between two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are not the same.

=== **"strict equal to"** 
to compare between two value to check that both the data type and value are the same. 

!== **"strict not equal to"**
to compare two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same. 

>= **"greater than or equal to"** 
to check if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right. 

<= **"less than or equal"** 
to check if the number on the lefts is less than or equal to the number on the right.

**Loop counters :** 

**There's two type of loop :** 

**1- "for loop"** 
- it is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly.
- it  uses a counter as a condiion.
- it  instucts the code to run specified number of times.
- it is made of three statements : Initilization \ condition \ update. 


**2- "while loop"** 
- it is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. 
- it can be thought of as a repeating if statement.
